This repository proposes creating a native web API to match URLs called URLPattern.  URLPattern would support both web developer use in JS and native URL matching in other web APIs.  For example, the initial use cases discuss using URLPattern for service worker scope matching.

For more information:

* The [explainer](explainer.md) discusses use cases and early API ideas.
* The [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17L6b3zlTHtyxQvOAvbK55gQOi5rrJLERwjt_sKXpzqc/edit) goes into more detail, including webidl and how the API might be implemented in Chromium.

For questions and feedback please use [Github Discussions](https://github.com/WICG/urlpattern/discussions).
